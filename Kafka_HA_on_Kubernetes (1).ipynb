It is extremely powerful but can be complex to set up and manage. One of the challenges in running Kafka is ensuring high availability (HA).",

For stateful applications like databases or Kafka, StatefulSets are the most suitable because they provide guarantees about the ordering and uniqueness of Pods.",
