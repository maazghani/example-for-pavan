      "source": "## Additional Information from Google Search\nThe Partition of India in 1947 was a significant event that led to the creation of two independent dominions in South Asia: India and Pakistan. This event was accompanied by the dissolution of the British Raj in the Indian subcontinent and the change of political borders. The partition resulted in a massive population exchange between the two newly formed states and violent riots. The estimated number of deaths ranges from 200,000 to 2 million. Here are some key points from the search results:\n\n1. The partition was a result of the Indian Independence Act 1947 passed by the British Parliament. The Act finalized the arrangements for partition, creating the Radcliffe Lines that demarcated the borders of India and Pakistan.\n\n2. The partition was accompanied by one of the largest mass migrations in human history. An estimated 10-20 million people were displaced from their homes.\n\n3. The partition led to widespread communal violence, causing the deaths of hundreds of thousands of people and the displacement of many more. The violence was particularly severe in Punjab and Bengal, the provinces that were divided by the new border.\n\n4. The partition had long-lasting effects on the region and continues to influence India-Pakistan relations to this day.",
