The plan will include the most efficient route, gas station stops, and rest stops. The steps we will follow are:\n\n1. **Route Planning**: Find the most efficient route from Dallas to Seattle using a mapping service.\n2. **Gas Station Stops**: Determine when and where to stop for gas based on the vehicle's fuel efficiency, the distance between gas stations, and the total distance of the trip.\n3. **Rest Stops**: Plan for rest stops based on the total driving time.",
