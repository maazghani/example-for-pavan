It is important to note that this guide assumes a familiarity with Terraform and its associated concepts.\nThe upgrade process is generally straightforward, but there are a few key areas to be aware of. These include understanding the compatibility promises made by HashiCorp, the creators of Terraform, and the specific changes that need to be made to your Terraform codebase.\nThis guide will serve as the introduction to a Confluence page where we will further describe the process of removing our Terraform codebase's pinning to Terraform 0.15.5 and re-running our plans that didn't include drift using Terraform 1.5.4.\nFor the rest of the team, the upgrade process will simply involve ensuring they are using Terraform 1.5.4 and addressing any issues that may arise.\nLet's get started!",
