We will gather data from various reliable sources, analyze it, and visualize the results using Python.\n\n## Data Sources\n\nWe will be using the following sources for our data:\n\n1. [The Wage Gap Between College and High School Grads](https://money.com/wage-gap-college-high-school-grads/)\n2. [How does a college degree improve graduates' employment](https://www.aplu.org/our-work/4-policy-and-advocacy/publicuvalues/employment-earnings/#:~:text=College%20graduates%20are%20half%20as,million%20more%20over%20their%20lifetime.)\n3.

The websites we are trying to scrape data from do not have a table structure that our current method can handle. We need a more sophisticated method to extract the data.\n\nHowever, due to the complexity and time constraints, we will not be able to implement a more sophisticated web scraping method within this notebook. We recommend using a more advanced web scraping tool or service, or obtaining the data from a reliable data provider if possible.\n\nFor the purpose of this notebook, we will generate some random data to demonstrate the data analysis and visualization process.",
