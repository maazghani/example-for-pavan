      "source": "# How can methamphetamine use induce iron deficiency aka anemia\n\nMethamphetamine use can have several effects on the body that may contribute to iron deficiency and anemia. According to a study published in the [Journal of Medical Case Reports](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3724445/), methamphetamine use can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, which can lead to iron deficiency anemia. The bleeding is caused by ischemic colitis, a condition where the blood flow to the colon is reduced. This is a result of the vasoconstrictive effects of methamphetamine.\n\nFurthermore, methamphetamine use can lead to poor nutrition and dietary habits. Users often neglect their diet and may not consume enough iron-rich foods, leading to iron deficiency. Additionally, methamphetamine use can cause inflammation and damage to the gut lining, impairing the absorption of nutrients, including iron.\n\nIt's also worth noting that methamphetamine use can lead to a range of other health problems, including heart disease, stroke, and mental health disorders. These conditions can further exacerbate the effects of anemia and make it more difficult to manage.",
